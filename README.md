# robot
A simple small game

This game is farily simple to play. 
First, download all the files to the local directory, and then use the terminal, and change the
working directory to that one. Then, type "make" and enter, the files will be compiled.
Type "java gamePlay" to run the game, then enter the x position and y position to indicate the
location of the robot as it asks to. 
Then, enter N, E, S or W to indicate the initial facing direction.

Follow the instructions and manipulate the robot!
M means move,
L means turn left,
R means turn right.

Notice, the robot is on a 8x8 square board. When it is on the edge, it can go beyond the range.
Have fun!
